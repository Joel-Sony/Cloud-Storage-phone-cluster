Databases are a core component of modern software systems. They provide persistent
storage, efficient querying, and concurrency control. Relational databases organize
data into tables with rows and columns, while NoSQL databases use alternative data models.

Transaction management ensures data consistency in the presence of concurrent access.
ACID properties define the guarantees provided by traditional database systems.
Distributed databases extend these ideas across multiple machines.

Replication and sharding are common techniques used in large-scale database systems.
Replication improves availability and fault tolerance, while sharding distributes data
across multiple nodes to improve performance and scalability.

Storage engines are responsible for how data is written to disk and retrieved.
Indexing structures such as B-trees and LSM trees are used to optimize query performance.
Choosing the right database system depends on workload characteristics and consistency
requirements.

Modern applications often combine databases with caching layers and message queues to
build scalable and responsive systems.
