Distributed systems are a fundamental area of computer science. A distributed system
consists of multiple independent computers that communicate over a network and
coordinate their actions to appear as a single coherent system.

In distributed systems, reliability and fault tolerance are critical concerns.
Failures are expected rather than exceptional. Components may fail independently,
messages may be delayed or lost, and networks may partition without warning.

Consistency, availability, and partition tolerance form the well-known CAP theorem.
According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can only guarantee two of the three
properties at any given time. Designers must choose trade-offs depending on the use case.

Distributed systems often rely on replication to improve availability and durability.
Replication introduces complexity in maintaining consistency across replicas.
Consensus algorithms such as Paxos and Raft are used to ensure agreement among nodes.

Scalability is another major goal of distributed systems. Horizontal scaling allows
systems to handle increased load by adding more machines rather than upgrading hardware.
This approach is common in cloud computing platforms and large-scale web services.

Understanding distributed systems requires thinking about concurrency, partial failure,
and the absence of a global clock. These challenges make distributed systems difficult
to design, implement, and reason about, but also extremely powerful.
