Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on building
systems that can learn from data. Instead of explicitly programming rules, machine
learning algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on examples.

Supervised learning is one of the most common machine learning paradigms. In supervised
learning, models are trained on labeled data, where each input is associated with a
correct output. Classification and regression are typical supervised learning tasks.

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. Clustering algorithms such as k-means
and hierarchical clustering attempt to discover structure within the data. Dimensionality
reduction techniques like principal component analysis are also widely used.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers.
Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech recognition,
and natural language processing. Training deep learning models often requires large
datasets and significant computational resources.

Machine learning systems must be evaluated carefully to avoid overfitting and bias.
Cross-validation, regularization, and proper dataset splits are essential for building
robust machine learning models that generalize well.
