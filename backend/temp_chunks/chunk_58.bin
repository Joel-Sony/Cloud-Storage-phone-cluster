Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects such as stars, planets, and galaxies.
It is one of the oldest sciences, with origins dating back to ancient civilizations that
observed the night sky.

Stars form from clouds of gas and dust through gravitational collapse. Over millions of
years, nuclear fusion ignites in their cores, releasing energy that we observe as light.
The life cycle of a star depends on its mass.

Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, and dark matter. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way,
contains billions of stars and planetary systems. Galaxies interact and merge over cosmic
timescales.

Astronomy relies heavily on observational data collected by telescopes operating across
the electromagnetic spectrum. Advances in technology have enabled discoveries such as
exoplanets, black holes, and gravitational waves.

The study of the universe helps scientists understand the origins of matter, energy, and
the fundamental laws of physics.
